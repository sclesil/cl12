<br><br>
The Services<br>
The third-party providers offer proxy services and data collection products as part of their Services. These providers allow their customers to route traffic through peers’ available resources. The third-party providers treat certain devices of peers as nodes within their network, which is used to operate the Services. Peers agree to share their available resources and become part of this network in exchange for benefits such as free features, ad-free apps, and similar rewards.
What types of information do the third-party providers collect?
The third-party providers collect the following types of data when you use their Services:
<li>Non-Personal Information: This is information that cannot be used to identify the individual from whom the data was collected. Examples of Non-Personal Information include aggregated usage data and technical information transmitted by your device, such as your approximate geographic location, hardware specifications, operating system and SDK version, browser type and version, the date of software installation, URL requests, and corresponding timestamps.</li>
<li>Personal Information: Personal Information refers to data that identifies or can potentially identify you. The only Personal Information collected and retained by the third-party providers is your IP address, which is necessary to provide their Services. Any Non-Personal Information that becomes specifically connected to Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information as long as the connection or linkage exists.</li>
<br><br>
Legal Basis for Processing<br>
The processing of Personal Information by the third-party providers is necessary to fulfill their contractual obligations to you, to provide you with their services, to protect their legitimate interests, and to comply with applicable legal obligations.
<br><br>
How the Third-Party Providers Use the Information Collected<br>
The third-party providers may use the information collected for the following purposes:
<li>To deliver and operate their Services, including conducting audits and calculating fees;</li>
<li>To detect and prevent illegal activities, violations of the Terms of Use, or any other actions that may compromise or negatively impact the integrity of the Services;</li>

<br><br>

Information the Third-Party Providers Share<br>
The third-party providers do not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with third parties except as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
They may transfer or disclose Personal Information to their subsidiaries, affiliated companies, subcontractors, or other trusted third-party service providers or partners located in various jurisdictions worldwide, for the following purposes: (a) storing or processing such information on their behalf (e.g., via cloud computing services), assisting with business operations, authenticating your access, and providing or improving the Services; (b) conducting research, technical diagnostics, analytics, or statistical purposes.
These activities are considered categories of Personal Information disclosed for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months, in accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1798.100 et seq.
The third-party providers may also share your Personal Information and other information in special circumstances where there is a legitimate belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with a law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; (2) detect, prevent, or address fraud, security breaches, policy violations, or technical issues; (3) enforce the provisions of this Privacy Policy or any other agreements between you and the third-party providers, including investigating potential violations; (4) protect the rights, property, or safety of the third-party providers, their partners, affiliates, users, or the public. The third-party providers have not sold your Personal Information (as defined under the CCPA) in the preceding 12 months.
<br><br>
Security and Confidentiality<br>
The third-party providers implement industry-standard security tools and measures, alongside internal procedures and strict guidelines, to prevent the misuse of information and mitigate the risk of data leakage. Access to information by employees and contractors is restricted on a need-to-know basis, and they are bound by confidentiality obligations.
While these measures significantly reduce the risk of data misuse, the third-party providers cannot guarantee that their systems will be completely secure. If you become aware of a potential data breach or security vulnerability, you are encouraged to notify the third-party providers immediately. They will take all necessary steps to investigate and address the incident, including implementing any required preventive measures.
As the third-party providers operate globally, it may be necessary to transfer your Personal Information to other countries. In such cases, they will ensure that your Personal Information receives a similar level of protection by employing adequate legal mechanisms, in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
<br><br>
Your Choices and Retention<br>
The third-party providers value your privacy and your control over personal information. If you wish to review or delete your Personal Information, you may notify the third-party providers by sending an email to the designated contact. You can choose at any time to prevent the collection of data about you by the third-party providers or any other entity. You may also request to view or edit the Personal Information that has been stored about you.
For EU Residents: The following rights specifically apply regarding your Personal Information under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):
<br>
Receive confirmation as to whether or not your Personal Information is being processed and access your stored Personal Information along with supplementary information;

Deny you goods or services;<br>
Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;<br>
Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services;<br>
Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.<br><br>
If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request a list of categories of Personal Information that may have been disclosed to third parties, and the details of such third parties. To exercise this right, you may contact the third-party providers at their designated contact address.
The third-party providers will retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to provide their services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce policies. Retention periods are determined based on the type of information collected and the purpose for its collection, while considering applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Outdated or unused information will be destroyed at the earliest reasonable opportunity.
The third-party providers reserve the right to rectify, update, or remove incomplete or inaccurate information at any time and at their sole discretion.
<br><br>
Change of Ownership<br>
In the event of a change in ownership or control of all or part of the third-party providers, including, but not limited to, through acquisition, merger, or sale, the third-party providers reserve the right to transfer all or part of the Personal Information stored in their systems.
<br><br>
Changes to this Privacy Policy<br>
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically at the sole discretion of the third-party providers, so please review it regularly. The date of the last revision will be indicated in the “Last Updated” heading. Any changes to this policy will be posted on the respective website.
